# wxPython - An Amazing alternative to regular Tkinter, is now in action

[wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) is a Python extension library for developing cross platform GUI. It is an alternative to other GUI development toolkits like [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro), [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) etc. This repostiory contains a variety of code examples for developing different GUI elements with wxPython. 

## Usage :-
Below simple module demonstrantes creation of two main objects in wxPython which are the main window object and the application object, followed by passing the control to the event-driven system by calling `MainLoop()` which manages the user-interactive part of the program.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import wx

class App(wx.App):
    def OnInit(self):
        frame = wx.Frame(parent=None, title='Bare')
        frame.Show()
        return True

app = App()
app.MainLoop()
```
